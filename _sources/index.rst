PYPHOT -- A tool for computing photometry from spectra
======================================================

This is a set of tools to compute synthetic photometry in a simple way, suitable for
integration in larger projects.

The inputs are response functions for the desired photometric passbands, and stellar spectra. The modules are flexible to handle units in the wavelength definition through 
a simplified version of `pint` (link)

Filters are represented individually by a `Filter` object. Collections of
filters are handled with a `Library`. We provide an internal library that
contains a signitificant amount of common filters. Note that we use the word "filter" 
in a generic sense: in many cases it corresponds in fact to a total throughput, that includes
the actual filter transmission, the transmission of the optics, the wavelength-dependent efficiency
of the detector, and (for ground-based photometric systems) the transmission of the 
atmosphere.

Each filter is minimally defined by a `wavelength`, a `throughput`, and a detector
type that may be either `energy` or `photon` (default). Many properties such as central 
or pivot wavelengths are computed internally. 

Units are provided for the wavelengths of the filters, zero points in
multiple units are also accessible (AB, Vega magnitude, Jy, erg/s/cm2/AA). The
default detector is assumed to be a photon-counting device, but energy-sensitive
detectors are also handled for the computations.

.. note::

        All provided filters have defined units and detector type
        that are used transparently throughout the package.

Package main content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package is mainly organized around two backend to handle quantities with units: a lightweight version of
`Pint`_ (:class:`pyphot.ezunits`) and the `Astropy Units <https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/index.html>`_. 
As these do no provide the same functionalities, the package is designed to be able to switch between the two by importing either from :class:`pyphot.sandbox` or :class:`pyphot.astropy`.

.. _Pint: https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

.. tip::

        You can transparently switch between pint and astropy units with aliasing the import line:

        .. code:: python

                from pyphot import astropy as pyphot
                # or 
                from pyphot import sandbox as pyphot


This package is mostly organized around 2 main classes (from either root module above):

* :class:`~pyphot.sandbox.UnitFilter` that handles filter definitions and manipulations.
 
* :class:`~pyphot.sandbox.UnitLibrary` that handles a collection of filters in a few formats. 


Additionally, and for convenience 

* the library class is derived into an ascii file reader
  :class:`~pyphot.phot.Ascii_Library`, and a single hdf file reader
  :class:`~pyphot.phot.HDF_Library`. 

* :class:`~pyphot.svo` provides an interface to the `SVO Filter Profile Service <http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/>`_ to download filters directly from the SVO database.

* :class:`~pyphot.vega.Vega` provides an interface to a synthetic reference of Vega.

* :class:`~pyphot.sun.Sun` provides an interface to a synthetic and empirical reference of the Sun spectrum.

* :class:`~pyphot.licks` provides an extension to computing lick indices.

Suppose one has a calibrated spectrum and wants to compute the corresponding vega magnitude
through the HST/WFC3 F110W passband: 

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        f = lib['hst_wfc3_f110w']
        # compute the integrated flux through the filter f
        # (note that 'spectra' can be a 2D array holding many spectra)
        fluxes = f.get_flux(lamb, spectra, axis=1)
        # convert fluxes to vega magnitudes
        mags = -2.5 * np.log10(fluxes) - f.Vega_zero_mag
        # or similarly
        mags = -2.5 * np.log10(fluxes / f.Vega_zero_flux)


To use one's own transmission curve, defined by `lamb_T` and
`T`, instead of one of the pre-defined ones, one would use 
the :class:`pyphot.phot.Filter` directly: 

.. code-block:: python

        # convert to magnitudes
        from pyphot import Filter
        # if lamb_T has units the Filter object will use those.
        f = Filter(lamb_T, T, name='my_filter', dtype='photon', unit='Angstrom')
        # compute the integrated flux through the filter f
        fluxes = f.get_flux(lamb, spectra, axis=1)
        ...

       
Internal Vega reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned in the above, sometimes a spectrum of reference of Vega is necessary. 

By default, we use the synthetic spectrum `alpha_lyr_stis_003` provided by `Bohlin 2007 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ASPC..364..315B/abstract>`_, a common reference
througout many photometric suites.

The interface to the Vega template is given through the :class:`pyphot.vega.Vega` class.

Since v.1.7.0, additional flavors and description of the internal Vega reference can be found on the :doc:`vega` page.

To use a specific Vega flavor for the photometric calculations in Pyphot, you can set the `vega` keyword parameter  when creating a passband or use the `set_vega_flavor` method to update it. 
For example, to use the `alpha_lyr_stis_011` flavor when creating a passband filter, you can do the following:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyphot.astropy import UnitFilter, Unit as u

    # Create a passband using the Vega flavor
    pb = UnitFilter(
        [4000, 5000, 6000] * u.AA,
        [0.1, 0.8, 0.1],
        name="Example Passband",
        dtype="photon"
        vega="stis_011"  # Specify the Vega flavor,
    )

Or alternatively, you can set/reset the Vega flavor after:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyphot import svo

    pb = svo.get_pyphot_filter("GALEX/GALEX.FUV")
    # Set the Vega flavor to use
    pb.set_vega_flavor("stis_011")


Internal Sun reference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also provide observed and theoretical references for the solar spectrum following 
`Colina, Bohlin, & Castelli 1996 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996AJ....112..307C/abstract>`_.

The observed solar spectrum comes from CALSPEC 
`sun_reference_stis_001.fits <ftp://ftp.stsci.edu/cdbs/current_calspec/sun_reference_stis_001.fits>`_ 
which provides the ultraviolet to near-infrared absolute flux distribution of
the Sun covering the 0.12-2.5 Î¼m wavelength range. The solar reference spectrum
combines absolute flux measurements from satellites and from the ground with a
model spectrum for the near-infrared. 

The theoretical spectrum comes from the Kurucz'93 atlas:
`<sun_kurucz93.fits ftp://ftp.stsci.edu/cdbs/grid/k93models/standards/sun_kurucz93.fits>`_
The theoretical spectrum is scaled to match the observed spectrum from 1.5 - 2.5 microns, and then it is used where the observed spectrum ends.
The theoretical model of the Sun uses the following parameters when the Sun is at 1 au:


.. list-table:: Solar Parameters
        :header-rows: 1

        * - log_Z
          - T_eff
          - log_g
          - V_{Johnson}
        * - +0.0
          - 5777
          - +4.44
          - -26.75

The interface to the Sun templates is given through the :class:`pyphot.sun.Sun` class.
